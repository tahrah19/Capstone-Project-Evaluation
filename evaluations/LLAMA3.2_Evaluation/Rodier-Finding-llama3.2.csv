"Rodier-Finding","Was the deceased considered a “person held in care” under the Coroners Act?","No. This was a rock-fishing incident at sea, not a death in custody or under institutional care ","No, the context does not provide any information that would suggest the deceased was being held in care.

"Rodier-Finding","Was there evidence of any substance or drug in the body?

The report only mentions that the investigation was conducted due to reasonable cause to suspect Frank's death and there are no further details regarding toxicology results."
"Rodier-Finding","Summarize the coroner’s findings in 2-3 sentences","Frank Edward Rodier died on 25 May 1975 at sea off Quobba Station near Red Bluff. The manner of death was accident, and the cause is unascertained (most likely drowning). His body was never recovered","The Acting State Coroner determined that there was reasonable cause to suspect that Frank had died, leading to a reportable death under the Act.

The coroner made this determination based on information provided by the WA Police in August 2023."

"Rodier-Finding","Differentiate between the immediate cause of death and contributing factors","Immediate cause: unascertained (most likely drowning) (page 6). Contributing factors: king wave; hazardous, jagged rocks; lack of rescue equipment on site; remote coastline conditions while rock fishing","Based on the provided context information, here is the differentiation between the immediate cause of death and contributing factors:

Immediate Cause of Death: The manner of death is established as an accident. However, the exact mechanism or event that led to his death (e.g., being washed off rocks while fishing) is not specified.

Contributing Factors:
1. Possible injury from falling on the rocks.
2. Contributory effect of this injury on his death.
 
The immediate cause of death cannot be determined with certainty as it involves speculation due to uncertainty over how the injury may have affected him, while the manner (accident) can indeed be stated."
"Rodier-Finding","Did the coroner evaluate the adequacy of supervision, treatment, or care provided? Explain the conclusion.","Not applicable in this case; the death occurred during a recreational activity at sea, not under institutional supervision or care ","Based on the context information provided, it can be inferred that the coroner did not specifically evaluate the adequacy of supervision, treatment, or care provided in relation to Frank's death. The decision made by the coroner was focused on determining whether there was reasonable cause to suspect that Frank had died and reporting the case as a reportable death under the Act.

However, it is likely that during the investigation initiated by the coroner, the authorities would have reviewed the circumstances surrounding Frank's death, including any potential supervision, treatment, or care provided. The investigation may have included an assessment of these factors to determine whether they contributed to Frank's death.

The fact that no prior knowledge was mentioned and there is no specific mention of a review of supervision, treatment, or care in the context provided suggests that the coroner did not explicitly evaluate these aspects in their decision-making process."
