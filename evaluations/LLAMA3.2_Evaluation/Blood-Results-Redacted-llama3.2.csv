1. Alcohol - Not Detected
2. Gamma Hydroxybutyric Acid (GHB) - Not Detected
3. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - Not Detected

"Blood-Results-Redacted","What kind of tests were performed? And why?","Immunoassay, gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry were used to detect and quantify substances in the blood sample.
