At 12:06 am he posted a photo of train tracks and at 12:21 am a message indicating he was going to take his life; at about 12:30 am he was struck by a freight train near SJOG
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,What relevant medical or mental health history did the deceased have?,"Long-standing mental health issues with prior deliberate self-harm and an attempted suicide; diagnoses over the years included a Cluster B personality disorder, mixed anxiety/depressive disorder, panic disorder and PTSD. He also had chronic pain, haemochromatosis and “Pyrrole disorder.”"
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,Who testified or assisted in the inquest?,"Witnesses: Dr Grainne Farrell, Dr Shona Curtin, Dr Fred English, Dr Mrinalini Sharma, Dr Mark Hall, Dr Stefan Schutte, and Ms Wendy James (mother). Mr J. Tiller assisted the coroner. "
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,Was the deceased considered a “person held in care” under the Coroners Act?,"No. This was a section 26(1) investigation (general jurisdiction), and at the time of death he had been discharged home and was not detained or otherwise “held in care.”"
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,Was there evidence of any substance or drug in the body? Summarise the toxicology findings.,"Toxicology showed therapeutic levels of amitriptyline, diazepam, duloxetine, oxycodone, paracetamol and quetiapine; low levels of oxazepam and ondansetron; alcohol and other common drugs were not detected. "
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,Summarize the coroner’s findings in 2-3 sentences,"The coroner found Mr Taulelei should have been admitted on 7 February 2020 and that his care that evening was demonstrably substandard. While acknowledging the limits of hindsight, the coroner considered it very likely that had he been admitted on 7 February, he would not have died in the manner that he did."
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,"Did the coroner make recommendations for future prevention? If yes, what were they?","The coroner did not make any formal recommendations for future prevention. Instead, the finding acknowledged that St John of God Midland Hospital had already introduced several improvements since Jacob Taulelei’s death, including a new risk assessment system (RAMP), enhanced handover and discharge procedures, stronger supervision and staffing arrangements, suicide prevention training under the PROTECT model, and plans for a dedicated mental health emergency centre. The coroner welcomed these measures and expressed hope that they would prevent similar tragedies, but no further recommendations were issued."
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,Differentiate between the immediate cause of death and contributing factors,"Immediate cause: Multiple injuries from being struck by a train. Contributing factors (as identified through evidence): ongoing mental health conditions and suicidality; deficient risk assessment and discharge planning, failure to escalate to the duty consultant, poor handover/documentation, lack of family involvement despite the mother’s role, bed availability issues on 5 Feb, and environmental risk (possession of a train timetable and the ED’s proximity to train tracks)."
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,"Did the coroner evaluate the adequacy of supervision, treatment, or care provided? Explain the conclusion.","Yes, the coroner evaluated the adequacy of supervision, treatment, and care provided to Jacob Taulelei and concluded that it was inadequate. The coroner found that Jacob should have been admitted to the hospital on 7 February 2020, and that discharging him home alone without contacting his mother was profoundly regrettable. The investigation identified deficiencies in communication, supervision, and discharge planning, concluding that the care provided by St John of God Midland Hospital on that occasion fell short of appropriate standards."
TAULELEI-Jacob-Finding.pdf,Does this case highlight any broader patterns or lessons relevant to public safety or institutional care?,"Yes, the case highlights broader lessons about systemic issues in institutional mental health care and public safety. It underscores the critical importance of thorough risk assessment, clear communication between staff, proper supervision of junior clinicians, and meaningful involvement of family members when patients present with suicidal ideation. The coroner’s findings reveal how procedural lapses—such as poor handovers, failure to escalate high-risk cases, and inadequate discharge planning—can have fatal consequences. The case illustrates the need for hospitals to adopt stronger, more integrated systems for managing mental health emergencies to prevent similar tragedies in the future."
