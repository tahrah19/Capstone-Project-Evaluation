"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","When did the death of  Ruby Natasha Nicholls occur? (date)","Between late 1 March 2011 and early 2 March 2011.","The death of Ruby Natasha Nicholls-Diver occurred between late 1 March and early 2 March 2011."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Where did the death of Ruby Natasha Nicholl occur? (location)","From a tree in a park near her home. The location where the death occurred is Geo Lithgow Reserve, Bicton.","Based on the provided context information, it appears that the location where Ruby's death occurred is near her home. Specifically, she was found hanging from a tree in an area near her home, with no other person present or visible in the vicinity."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","What was the cause of death?","Ligature compression of the neck (hanging). Manner: Suicide.","Here are the causes of death for each individual:

1. Stephen Colin Robson: Multiple injuries due to severe chest injury with internal fracturing of the ribcage and bruising of the lungs, pelvic injury, and bone injury.
2. Anthony Ian Edwards: Multiple injuries resulting from a fall, but no external evidence of foul play or involvement of another person.
3. Michael Roland Thomas: Cause of death unknown/unascertainable due to lack of information on the mechanism of his death."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Who was the presiding coroner?","Rosalinda Clorinda Vincenza Fogliani, State Coroner.","There is no direct mention of who the presiding coroner was. However, based on the record of investigation into death, there were two inquests held on the same day (28 April 2015) by two different coroners:

- For Anthony Ian Edwards: The identity of the deceased person and other relevant details are recorded.
- For Stephen Colin ROBSON: The identity of the deceased person and other relevant details are recorded.

It is not specified who presided over which inquest."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","What were the circumstances leading to the death?","Ruby (18) voluntarily presented to Alma Street Centre on 26 Feb 2011 after deteriorating mental health. On 28 Feb 2011 she attempted to hang herself on the ward; staff commenced 15-minute observations. On 1 Mar 2011 she asked to go home; Dr Steve Baily approved same-day discharge. Her father (primary carer) was not contacted, despite being closely involved. She took a bus home that afternoon/evening; that night she hanged herself in a park near her home and was found early 2 Mar 2011; paramedics confirmed death.","The circumstances leading to Anthony Ian Edwards' death involved the following events:

1. He was an occupational therapy client at Alma Street Centre.
2. His care from Alma Street Centre was anticipated to be followed up by a case manager, but no procedure for this was documented.
3. The occupational therapist was also going to follow him up, though no time frame was specified.
4. Shortly before his death, Anthony consumed alcohol and jumped from a significant height at the rear of an apartment building to the ground below.
5. Before jumping, he sent a text message that reflected his intention to take his life.
6. CCTV footage confirmed Anthony's intention to take his life.

It is worth noting that there was no involvement of another person in Anthony's death, and police investigated with no findings of external involvement."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","What relevant medical or mental health history did the deceased have?","Longstanding mental-health difficulties from childhood with emotionally unstable/borderline personality disorder features, chronic suicidality and self-harm. Extensive involvement with CAMHS; recently transitioned to adult services (Alma Street) shortly before her death.","Based on the provided context information, it is mentioned that several of the former patients had a history of diagnosed mental illnesses, specifically:

* Four former patients had been at chronic risk of suicide for a number of years.
* Three of the former patients were young adults, with one being just 18 years old."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Was there evidence of any substance or drug in the body? Summarise the toxicology findings","Post-mortem by Dr J. McCreath; toxicology noted blood alcohol present and an antidepressant consistent with treatment. No evidence of third-party involvement.","Yes, there was evidence of certain substances or drugs found in the bodies of the deceased individuals. Here is a summary of the toxicological findings:

* Michael Roland Thomas:
 + Therapeutic level of antidepressant medication
 + No alcohol or illicit drugs detected
 + Toxicology results must be interpreted with caution due to degree of decomposition affecting samples
* Stephen Colin Robson:
 + Therapeutic levels of prescribed anti-psychotic medication and anti-depressant medication
 + No alcohol or illicit drugs detected"
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Who testified or assisted in the inquest? (eg, doctors, police, witnesses)","Dr Steve Baily (treating consultant psychiatrist), Dr Claire Keating (registrar), Dr Caroline Goossens (psychiatrist/author of comprehensive clinical entry), Nurse Daus (ward nurse), Dr J. McCreath (forensic pathologist), and Mr Diver (Ruby’s father). Counsel assisting: Ms Kate Ellson.","The following individuals testified or assisted in the inquest:

6. Solicitor's office representatives: Ms Rachel Young (on behalf of the Department of Health Fremantle Hospital and Health Service) 
7. Counsel assisting the State Coroner: Ms Kate Ellson
8. Private counsel:
  - Mr Chris Stokes (on behalf of the Thomas family)
  - Mr Dominic Bourke (on behalf of Dr Caroline Goossens)"
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Was the deceased considered a “person held in care” under the Coroners Act?","No. She had been discharged and was not detained or otherwise “held in care” at the time of death","Yes, according to the provided context information, Stephen was described as ""a person held in care as described in section 3 of the Coroners Act"" and further elaborated that he was an involuntary patient within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1996."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Summarize the coroner’s findings in 2-3 sentences.","The coroner found Ruby’s care and discharge on 1 March 2011 were seriously deficient: there was no clear risk management plan, her recent ward hanging attempt was not properly integrated into risk formulation, and her father was not contacted before sending her home alone. The decision to discharge, without adequate planning or carer involvement, fell below the standard expected of a mental-health service and contributed to her death.","The coroner's findings focused on the insufficient engagement with carers, leading to missed vital information and clinical judgments being made in their absence. This was attributed to time pressures and a lack of understanding of the valuable contributions that carers can make. The coroner emphasized the importance of taking information from carers to assist in making clinical judgments, particularly when deciding on discharge."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Did the coroner make recommendations for future prevention? If yes, what were they?","Yes,system-wide recommendations (arising from the broader Alma Street inquest but directly relevant to Ruby’s case): Implement Carer’s Plans with clear information on diagnosis/medication, relapse-prevention steps, when to proactively re-engage services, and supports for carers. Establish procedures to account for longitudinal risk (history across services), and strengthen discharge planning and community follow-up. Continue resourcing reforms (e.g., service re-organisation and emergency/community response improvements).","Based on the provided context information, it appears that no explicit recommendations for future prevention are mentioned in the text. However, the letter from Professor Stokes (Exhibit 10, Tab 5) is implied to have been received by the coroner after the conclusion of the inquest.

It can be inferred that the coroner may have considered recommendations or findings from external sources, but they are not explicitly stated in the provided context information."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Differentiate between the immediate cause of death and contributing factors (eg, drugs, mental health, environment)","Immediate cause: Hanging (ligature compression of the neck). Contributing factors: Borderline personality disorder with chronic suicidality; recent in-hospital hanging attempt; inadequate risk formulation and documentation; failure to contact/engage her father; discharge home alone on the day of death; environmental opportunity (accessible park near home). Alcohol was present but there’s no indication it was the principal cause.","Based on the provided context information, it is challenging to determine the exact cause of Stephen's death. However, we can infer some potential contributing factors that may have played a role:

Immediate Cause of Death: Not explicitly stated in the text.

Contributing Factors:

1. Mental Health: Stephen was diagnosed with an alcohol-induced mood disorder, depression, and dysthymia. His mental health condition seemed to worsen after his final admission.
2. Substance Abuse: He had a history of alcohol dependence and abuse of prescribed sedatives.
3. Medication Non-Adherence: Despite having multiple medical reviews and team discussions about his case, Stephen did not improve after this final admission, suggesting that he may not have been adhering to his medication regimen.
4. Lack of Progress in Treatment: The fact that Stephen did not show improvement following a combination of treatment approaches (medication, group therapy, interventions for alcohol dependence) suggests that the treatment may not have been effective or was not adequately implemented.
5. Environmental Factors: While not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that environmental factors, such as social isolation or family dynamics, may have contributed to Stephen's mental health condition and lack of improvement.

It is essential to note that the text does not provide a clear understanding of the immediate cause of death, making it difficult to differentiate between the immediate cause and contributing factors. A thorough investigation would be necessary to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Stephen's death."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Did the coroner evaluate the adequacy of supervision, treatment, or care provided? Explain the conclusion.","Yes. The coroner concluded the standard of care was inadequate: no clear admission or risk-management plan, poor response to the ward attempt, no reformulation of risk before discharge, and no carer contact. Overall, the actions and omissions fell below what would ordinarily be expected.","Based on the context information, it appears that the coroner did evaluate the adequacy of Stephen's supervision, treatment, and care. The coroner commented on the quality of medical treatment and care provided to Stephen while he was an involuntary patient at Alma Street Centre, stating that the standard and quality of treatment were adequate and appropriate in the circumstances.

However, with respect to his supervision, the coroner expressed concerns about the inadequacy of security measures in place when Stephen absconded from court, which led them to conclude that the quality of his supervision fell below the standard expected for an involuntary mental health service."
"Nicolls-Diver-Finding","Does this case highlight any broader patterns or lessons relevant to public safety or institutional care?","Yes-clear lessons include: use structured risk formulation (not “no self-harm contracts”), escalate/delay discharge after acute self-harm, embed carer involvement as default, ensure safe discharge arrangements (avoid sending high-risk patients home alone), and maintain systems that carry forward longitudinal risk across child-to-adult transitions.","Yes, this case highlights several broader patterns and lessons relevant to public safety and institutional care. The report's findings suggest that:

1. **Insufficient security measures**: The lack of adequate security measures in place at Alma Street Centre for containing an involuntary patient on escorted ground access in the courtyard is a significant concern. This highlights the need for institutions to prioritize the safety and security of patients, particularly those with elevated risk.
2. **Inadequate protocols for missing persons**: The report notes that once an involuntary patient leaves the institution's grounds, staff do not attempt to apprehend them, and it becomes a police matter. This suggests that institutional protocols for handling missing persons may need to be revisited to ensure timely intervention and containment.
3. **Lack of standardization in security measures**: The fact that Alma Street Centre did not have adequate security measures in place, unlike Dr. Gibson's expectation of a locked ward courtyard with smoking areas, highlights the importance of standardizing security protocols across institutions to prevent similar incidents.
4. **Importance of timely intervention**: The report emphasizes the need for immediate action when an involuntary patient goes missing from the institution's grounds. This underscores the importance of having robust alarm systems and prompt staff response times to prevent harm to patients and the public.

These findings have broader implications for public safety and institutional care, emphasizing the need for:

* Enhanced security measures in institutions caring for vulnerable populations
* Standardized protocols for handling missing persons and containment procedures
* Timely intervention and cooperation between institutions and law enforcement agencies when an involuntary patient goes missing

By learning from this case, institutions can implement improvements to prevent similar incidents and prioritize the safety and well-being of patients and the public."
