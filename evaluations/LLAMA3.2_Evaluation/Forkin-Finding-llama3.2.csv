"Forkin-Finding","Who was the deceased?","The deceased was Luke Isaac Forkin, born in Western Australia on 23 October 1982 (page 4)","Based on the provided context information, the deceased appears to be a man whose full name is not mentioned in the text. He was born in Western Australia on October 23, 1982, into a blended family. He had a close relationship with his mother and step-father when he was younger, but later became a loner and struggled with substance abuse, leading to various criminal offenses and health issues, including being shot by his step-father in 2002."
"Forkin-Finding","When did the death occur? (date)","The death occurred on 30 November 2010 (page 1","Based on the provided context information, it is unclear exactly when the death occurred, as the time of death was not explicitly stated. However, according to event 63, Mr Ward and his wife returned home from work at about 4:00pm, noticed that the front door was locked, and found the deceased hanging by his neck with an electrical cord tied to a rafter through an open manhole in the ceiling.

Since they left for work at 6:30am, it can be inferred that the death occurred sometime between 4:00pm and 6:30pm."
"Forkin-Finding","Where did the death occur? (location)","The death occurred at 33A Snowbird Gardens, Joondalup, Western Australia (page 1)","The death occurred at 33A Snowbird Gardens, Joondalup."
"Forkin-Finding","What was the cause of death?","The cause of death was ligature compression of the neck (hanging) (page 14).","The cause of death was ligature compression of the neck (hanging)."
"Forkin-Finding","Who was the presiding coroner?","The presiding coroner was Barry Paul King (page 1).","Based on the provided context, the presiding Coroner is Ms R Hartley."
"Forkin-Finding","What were the circumstances leading to the death?","Mr. Forkin, an involuntary patient at Graylands Hospital, absconded from the hospital on 29 November 2010 during unescorted ground access. He went to stay at a friend’s house in Joondalup, where he was found the next day hanging by an electrical cord tied to a roof rafter (pages 13–14)","The circumstances leading to the death were as follows:

1. The deceased, Mr Ward (also referred to in some documents as the person who died), left for work with his wife at 6.30am.
2. They assumed he was still asleep and did not see him before leaving.
3. Upon returning home around 4.00pm from work, they found the front door locked, indicating that Mr Ward had not returned with them.
4. When Mr Ward entered the house, he discovered the deceased hanging by his neck with an electrical cord tied to a rafter through an open manhole in the ceiling.
5. Mr Ward cut the cord and provided chest compressions until ambulance paramedics arrived.

These events occurred on the day of the incident, but the exact time was not specified in the provided documents."
"Forkin-Finding","What relevant medical or mental health history did the deceased have?","He had a history of drug abuse (amphetamines, cannabis, heroin), psychotic episodes, suicidal behavior, and antisocial personality traits. Diagnoses included amphetamine-induced psychosis and polysubstance abuse. He had also previously attempted suicide by hanging in 2008 (pages 5–8)","The deceased had a significant history of mental health issues and substance abuse, including:

* Psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia
* Drug withdrawal
* Amphetamine-induced psychosis
* Ongoing paranoid psychotic episodes exacerbated by substance abuse
* Suicidal ideation on multiple occasions (in 2005 and 2007)
* Auditory hallucinations
* History of intravenous amphetamine use

The deceased had a pattern of using amphetamines, which led to several hospitalizations and diagnoses related to psychosis secondary to substance use.

It is also worth noting that the deceased's relationship with his partner ended shortly before the incident in 2007, which may have contributed to his suicidal behavior."
"Forkin-Finding","Who testified or assisted in the inquest?","Those who assisted or gave evidence included Dr. R. Iyyalol and Dr. F. Rosell (treating psychiatrists), Dr. N. Gibson (Chief Psychiatrist), Nathan Ward (friend who discovered the body), paramedics and police officers, Dr. C. T. Cooke (Chief Forensic Pathologist), Ms. M. Smith (assisting the Coroner), and Ms. R. Hartley (State Solicitor’s Office, for the Department of Health) (pages 1, 15–19)","Based on the provided context information, it appears that Coroner DH. Mulligan conducted the initial inquests. However, due to his inability to make findings under s.25 of the Coroners Act 1996, he was directed by Acting State Coroner Evelyn Vicker to investigate the deaths.

Additionally, interested parties who were present at the inquests before Coroner Mulligan were invited to make fresh or further submissions, which implies that some individuals testified or assisted in the proceedings."
"Forkin-Finding","Was the deceased considered a “person held in care” under the Coroners Act?","Yes. He was an involuntary patient under the Mental Health Act 1996 and therefore a “person held in care” as defined by section 3 of the Coroners Act 1996 (page 2).","Yes, based on the context information provided, the deceased, Luke Isaac Forkin, was considered a ""person held in care"" under the Coroners Act 1996 because he was an involuntary patient at Graylands Hospital (Graylands) when his death occurred."
"Forkin-Finding","Was there evidence of any substance or drug in the body? Summarise the toxicology findings.","Yes. Toxicology results showed therapeutic and sub-therapeutic levels of prescription drugs and low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), indicating recent cannabis use within 24 hours before death (page 14).","Yes, there was evidence of substances in the deceased's body. The toxicology analysis showed:

* Therapeutic levels of prescription medicines
* Sub-therapeutic levels of prescription medicines
* A low level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), indicating the use of cannabis within 24 hours.

The findings suggest that the deceased had a history of substance abuse, including amphetamines, cannabis, heroin, LSD, and ecstasy."
"Forkin-Finding","Summarize the coroner’s findings in 2-3 sentences","The coroner found that Luke Forkin committed suicide by hanging while absent without leave from Graylands Hospital. The care, treatment, and supervision were reasonable and appropriate, and the decision to grant unescorted ground access was justified by his apparent stability (pages 20–21).","Based on the provided context, the coroner did not address general issues separately from their examination of each individual death. However, they acknowledged that evidence related to systemic issues at Graylands was presented to investigate whether these issues affected the deaths and care provided to deceased patients. The coroner concluded that many of these general issues were not sufficiently connected to all the respective deaths for them to comment on under Section 25."
