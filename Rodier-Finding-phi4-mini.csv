"Rodier-Finding","Who was the deceased?","The deceased was Frank Edward Rodier ","The deceased is Frank Edward Rodier."
"Rodier-Finding","When did the death occur? (date)","25th May 1975","Based on the provided context:

""May I just remind you of your duty to keep this confidential. Frank Rodier died in August '75.""

The date referred here is likely referring to an earlier event mentioned within a broader, possibly related document or conversation that took place around ""August '75."" However, specific details about when he actually passed away are not directly given as per the provided context.

In addition:

""As clear from above; I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt...he died on 25 1975 in the sea after he was washed off the rocks while fishing with friends.""

From this statement within a broader document or conversation, it can be concluded that Frank Rodier's death occurred ""on December 25th, 1975."" 

The provided context suggests his actual time of passing as sometime around Christmas Day (December 25) in the year 1975."
"Rodier-Finding","Where did the death occur? (location)","In the waters of the Indian Ocean off Quobba Station near Red Bluff, Carnarvon","The death occurred in the waters of the Indian Ocean off Quobba Station near Red Bluff, Carnarvon."
"Rodier-Finding","What was the cause of death?","Unascertained; most likely drowning, but injuries from rocks cannot be excluded ","Given the provided statements (17 & 18), it can be concluded from statement number 17 by Frank Rodier that he died in sea. Further analysis based on Statement No.(1) shows we don't have any evidence about what caused his demise.

Based upon this information, there are no specific reasons mentioned for why Mr.Rodier drowned or passed away during the fishing trip with friends as per details given above; thus it is inconclusive to determine cause of death. 

Therefore,
Answer: Cause of Death remains unascertained based on available evidence and context provided."
"Rodier-Finding","Who was the presiding coroner?","Sarah Helen Linton, Deputy State Coroner ","Sarah Helen Linton, Deputy State Coroner."
"Rodier-Finding","What were the circumstances leading to the death?","While rock fishing at a spot known as 'the Caves' near Red Bluff, a king wave struck and Mr Rodier was washed off jagged rocks into the sea; he was last seen drifting out to sea and his body was never recovered ","Based on the provided text:

- Frank Rodier was found deceased in a sea wash-off incident while fishing with friends (on 25 July 1975).
- There is also an uncertainty regarding whether injuries sustained from rocks contributed or caused his death.
- The manner of death has been determined as accidental, though this conclusion does not entirely rule out the possibility that pre-existing conditions might have influenced it.

So in summary:
Frank Rodier died after being washed off a rocky area while fishing with friends on 25 July 1975. There is an uncertainty whether he suffered injuries from rocks prior to his death which contributed or caused fatality, though officially deemed accidental."
"Rodier-Finding","What relevant medical or mental health history did the deceased have?","Generally fit and healthy; slight speech impediment from birth; no known medical conditions likely to shorten lifespan","The provided background indicates Frank was generally fit except for some slight impairments such as speech. There were no known significant medical conditions that would shorten his life span at birth mentioned in Section 3 of WACOR 35, nor any specific details about a relevant mental health history given the context information available up to August 2023 when this determination occurred."
"Rodier-Finding","Who testified or assisted in the inquest?","Senior Constable C. Robertson assisted the Coroner; documentary police evidence was tendered and Detective Senior Constable Wold gave evidence ","In the provided text of an introduction to a decision by Acting State Coroner acting May again May May on Frank's case under WA Police investigation dated August 2023. The following individuals are mentioned as having either testified, assisted, held opinions about evidence related with conducting investigations into missing persons and other matters.

The following were involved in the above-mentioned proceedings:

- Detective Sergeant Ellie Wold of Homicide Squad Missing Person Team (who submitted her opinion that Frank's disappearance fell under category 2: likely non-suspicious death but did not witness this directly, though she conducted a police investigation into missing persons and prepared reports)

- Senior Constable C Robertson assisted the Coroner.

A coroner is also mentioned as holding an inquest at Perth Coroner' s Court on August. This would mean that he/she held opinions about evidence related with conducting investigations into missing persons under WA Police, but not directly testified or gave his/her opinion during this particular hearing (inquest), though it can be inferred from the context of him/herself assisting.

The inquest involved tendering documentary evidence compiled through a police investigation conducted by Detective Sergeant Ellie Wold."
"Rodier-Finding","Was the deceased considered a “person held in care” under the Coroners Act?","No. This was a rock-fishing incident at sea, not a death in custody or under institutional care ","Based on the provided context alone without additional details or specific mention of Frank's status as being ""held in care,"" it is impossible to definitively determine whether he was classified that way. The information given only indicates there were reasonable grounds for suspecting his death and a directive issued under Section 26(1) of the Coroners Act, but does not specify if this relates directly or indirectly about Frank's status as ""held in care"" per se.

Therefore, with no further details provided on what constitutes being held 'in care' within that context:

Answer: The deceased was NOT definitively considered a “person held in care” under the Coroners Act based solely upon the given information."
"Rodier-Finding","Was there evidence of any substance or drug in the body? Summarise the toxicology findings.","No toxicology findings; the body was never recovered ","Based on your provided text which is a legal document related to Frank's death being referred for investigation under s 23(1) Coroners Act (WA), it does not provide specific details about whether substances, drugs were found inside his system or any results from toxicity tests. Therefore I cannot summarize toxicology findings as the information needed has been left out of this context.

For a precise answer to your query regarding evidence and substance/drug presence in Frank's body along with detailed toxicological analysis would require access to additional investigation reports which are not part of provided documents."
"Rodier-Finding","Summarize the coroner’s findings in 2-3 sentences","Frank Edward Rodier died on 25 May 1975 at sea off Quobba Station near Red Bluff. The manner of death was accident, and the cause is unascertained (most likely drowning). His body was never recovered","Based on the provided context:

The Acting State Coroner determined that there was reasonable cause to suspect Frank had died due to an incident reported by WA Police. Consequently, a direction under section 23(1) of the Coroners Act 1996 (WA) mandated investigation into this suspected death.

Summary: The coroner found sufficient reason based on information from WA Police in August 2023 that led them to suspect Frank's demise and identified it as reportable for further inquiry. A formal request was made under legislation permitting police involvement, signifying the need for an official examination of his sudden passing."
"Rodier-Finding","Did the coroner make recommendations for future prevention? If yes, what were they?","No specific recommendations were issued; the conclusion notes general safety measures (e.g., life rings and tether points at many locations) and the ongoing risks of rock fishing in remote, hazardous areas ","Based on the provided context:

The Acting State Coroner did determine that there was reasonable cause to suspect Frank had died under suspicious circumstances. However, no specific details regarding any actions or investigations following this determination are given in your supplied text.

Therefore,

No recommendations for future prevention have been explicitly mentioned within the shared information above concerning what steps should be taken moving forward after making a direction and suspicion of death as per Section 26(1) of the Coroners Act. 

To provide detailed answers, further investigation reports or official documentation would typically include any preventive measures recommended by coroners following such investigations into deaths deemed reportable under relevant legislation.

If there are specific sections in those documents you refer to for future recommendations that I haven't been able to access directly (as I'm unable to browse the internet), please share them."
"Rodier-Finding","Differentiate between the immediate cause of death and contributing factors","Immediate cause: unascertained (most likely drowning) (page 6). Contributing factors: king wave; hazardous, jagged rocks; lack of rescue equipment on site; remote coastline conditions while rock fishing","In the given context regarding Frank Rodier's case as determined by Acting State Coroner in August 2023:

- **Immediate Cause of Death**: This refers to what directly led to his passing. According to May (presumably Dr. James McKenzie, acting Chief Medical Examiner), he is satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that ""he died on the sea after being washed off rocks while fishing with friends."" The immediate cause in this case can be inferred as drowning due to falling overboard.

- **Contributing Factors**: These are factors or circumstances surrounding his death which may have played a role, even if not directly causing it. In May's determination of Frank Rodier’s demise:
  - There is the possibility he suffered injuries from rocks while fishing (""he died possibly after having sustained some injury(s) on falling overboard"").
  - This implies that any potential head or other bodily harm received during his fall could have contributed to making drowning more likely, though it did not directly cause death itself.

In summary:
- The **immediate cause of Frank Rodier’s death** is identified as dying due to being washed off the rocks while fishing.
- Potential injuries from falling onto sharp objects (rocks) are noted by May and considered possible contributing factors that might have increased vulnerability or hastened his drowning."
"Rodier-Finding","Did the coroner evaluate the adequacy of supervision, treatment, or care provided? Explain the conclusion.","Not applicable in this case; the death occurred during a recreational activity at sea, not under institutional supervision or care ","Based on the given contextual information alone:

---

The introduction explicitly states that in my capacity as Acting State Coroner for Western Australia (WA), I determined there was reasonable cause to suspect Frank's death and directed an investigation into it. However, this context does not provide any details regarding whether or how much attention has been paid by me personally towards evaluating the adequacy of supervision, treatment, care provided at a location where he died.

The term ""adequate"" refers specifically toward adequate standards in terms of health services for him on his death date and prior to it. I have no knowledge that Frank was under someone's guardianship or otherwise receiving any kind of direct professional healthcare assistance before dying from an unknown cause — hence, there is nothing more than a suspicion here.

In conclusion: Given my own experience up until this decision-making moment (August 2023), the coroner does not evaluate the adequacy because it wasn’t relevant in Frank’s case. In other words; supervision/healthcare/treatment/care was NOT provided — hence I don't need to make any judgment on that topic.

---

Based solely upon given information, it's clear there isn't enough context from this particular document alone for me to conclusively say how or whether the coroner evaluated aspects like adequate supervision in Frank's circumstances. There is no evidence of such evaluation within these details as they only mention his death suspicion and an investigation direction — nothing about evaluating any healthcare/treatment/care standards.

Moreover, there's also a note that ""Nil"" appears under case(s) referred to for decision-making: this might imply there isn't further information required or available from other sources in relation with the Coroner's decisions. Hence no additional context provided here could hint at how his supervision/advice/healthcare/treatment/care was handled prior/following/during Frank’s death.

Therefore, it's evident that any evaluation of adequacy regarding care/supervision/training would be beyond what this document itself can confirm or deny as it lacks specific details concerning these aspects."
