Under s.25 (3) of the Coroners Act 1996, where a death investigated by a coroner is of a person held in care, the coroner must comment on the quality of the supervision, treatment and care of the person while in that care.\n- The death of the deceased was investigated   together with the death of nine other persons who immediately before death had been persons held in care as involuntary  patients at Graylands under the Mental Health Act 1996.", "page_no": 2, "source": "data/Forkin-finding-2014.pdf"}

As to the standard of treatment and care of the deceased, it is important to note that the deceased was difficult patient much of the time. He was aggressive and demanding to nursing staff and other patients, seeking drugs and trying to manipulate the system for his gratification. He was superficially cooperative with medical officers and psychiatrists, but is seems that his polite behaviour was calculated to obtain benefits, especially ground access to enable him to abscond.\n72.

In these circumstances , the deceaseds   treating team were guided by the   requirement to apply the least restrictive approach possible in the treatment of the deceased and allowed him to have unescorted ground access.\n4. 77 . In my view, there is no reasonable basis for any criticism of the risk assessment of the deceased before allowing him unescorted ground access or of the decision to allow him the access. While there was always the risk that he deceased might abscond, the probability that he would commit suicide appeared low. Had he not been granted access, there would have been legitimate criticisms that his treatment was unreasonably restrictive.\n78. Dr Iyyalol stated that it was not possible to make such decisions with respect to the deceased without risk because of the deceased's impulsivity. 40", "page_no": 16, "source": "data/Forkin-finding-2014.pdf"}

As to the delay in declaring the deceased AWOL, it is likely that the deceased was granted unescorted ground access at about 2.OOpm on 29 November 2010. Because of other exigencies when the shift handover procedure took place at about 3.OOpm, the deceaseds failure to return to the ward by 3.OOpm was not brought to the attention of the incoming ward coordinator until 3.45pm. The search that ensued in accordance with the policy for absconding patients was completed by 5.45pm, at which time the ward co-ordinator informed\n40 Ex 1, Vol 2, Tab 48, para 49\nDr Roswell that the deceased had absconded and he directed that the deceased be declared AWOL.", "page_no": 16, "source": "data/Forkin-finding-2014.pdf"}

Moreover, taking into account the fact that the police actions resulting from the deceased being declared AWOL were ineffective, 41 presumably because police could not have had any inkling of where the deceased was likely to have gone, the delay was ultimately of little or no consequence in any event.\n82. Similar considerations are relevant to the fourth issue: the lack of proper   record-keeping of the deceaseds ground access.\n4. 83 The evidence in relation to this issue was that nurses at Graylands are required to make entries on specialised forms each time a patient goes on ground access.

The last of the issues identified above is the legality of keeping the deceased in Graylands as an involuntary patient after his psychotic symptoms had ceased. This issue arose because of Dr Iyyalols evidence.\n2. Dr Iyyalol said that on 23 November 2010 he was considering releasing the deceased in a few days and that he was not concerned for the deceaseds safety , but that he was concerned about the deceased as a threat to his mother.42 On 24 November 2010 the deceaseds treating team were informed about the deceaseds pending court appearance. The team decided to keep the deceased in Graylands for two more weeks because of concern for his mother's safety and in order to support him through the court appearance given that he had expressed self-harm ideation previously and the appearance could be a very stressful time for him. 43\n88. Dr Iyyalol said that the decision to keep the deceased in Graylands was based on his threat to others rather than on his mental health or psychiatric illness.

In contrast to Dr Iyyalol, Dr Gibson's expressed the view that personality disorders are treatable mental illnesses in accordance with the Mental Health Act 1996 depending on the individual patients circumstances. He says that there are international   guidelines on the treatment of antisocial personality disorder, but that there is not a lot of research evidence on the best treatment, and the definitions and diagnoses of the disorders are not absolutely robust.\n92. As I understand him, Dr Gibson said that the evolution of personality disorders has been much more fluid over the years, an application of the Mental Health Act 1996 to personality disorders would not be based on criteria that would remain consistent.\n93.

While it appears   likely that the   particular stressors affecting the deceased at the time of his suicide were a pending court appearance which was likely to result in imprisonment  and the destruction of his relationship with his mother, any conclusion in relation to this aspect of his death would involve a mixture of assumption and speculation.\n99. It does seem clear that the deceased suffered from personality disorder and substance abuse issues which together affected him adversely as to require involuntary admissions in Graylands.
