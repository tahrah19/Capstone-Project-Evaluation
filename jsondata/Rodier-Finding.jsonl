In the report, Frank was confirmed to be a long term missing person, with his disappearance first reported to police at about 10.25 am on 25 1975. In 2006, a review by police had determined Frank's disappearance fell into the category of a non-suspicious death. Later enquiries by members of the Missing Person Team in 2015 and 2023 confirmed that Frank's family had not seen or heard from him after he disappeared on 25 1975 and 'proof of life' checks found no record of him in Australia from that time. Det   A/Sgt Wold submitted that   the evidence supported the conclusion that Frank was deceased and his death likely occurred as a result of drowning on the morning of 25 1975.2 Acting May again May May\n- 4 As required under s 23(2) of the Act, I held an inquest at the Perth Coroner' s Court on 13 August 2024.
