There is now no longer a physical medical record for a child attending a child health centre but rather CHIS electronic records which are visible to all community health clinicians.\n156. Another improvement was introduced in December 2018 when WACHS and Child and Adolescent Health Service implemented a protocol titled 'Clients of Concern Management?
